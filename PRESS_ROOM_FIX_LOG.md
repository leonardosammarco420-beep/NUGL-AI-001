# Press Room Data Population - Fix Log

## Issue
Press Room page was empty - no press releases were displaying.

## Root Cause
The press releases database collection was empty. The populate script had not been run to insert the initial data.

## Solution
Ran the populate script to insert 91 press releases into the MongoDB database.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Diagnosis
```bash
# Checked the API endpoint
curl http://localhost:8001/api/press-releases
# Result: [] (empty array)
```

### 2. Located Populate Script
- Found: `/app/backend/populate_press_releases.py`
- Contains 91 press releases about Kaya and Jamaica cannabis industry
- Sources: Forbes, Rolling Stone, NY Times, Gleaner, Observer, Benzinga, etc.

### 3. Executed Population Script
```bash
cd /app/backend && python populate_press_releases.py
```

**Output:**
```
ðŸ“° Populating Press Room with releases...
âœ… Inserted 91 press releases
```

### 4. Verification
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/press-releases | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Result:** âœ… 91 press releases successfully returned

## Press Release Content

### Data Structure

- `id`: Unique UUID

- `media_source`: Publication name
- `link`: URL to original article
- `published_at`: Timestamp

## Frontend Date Parsing Note
The Press Room page has date extraction logic that attempts to parse dates from article URLs. There's a known issue with Benzinga URLs showing incorrect years (e.g., "4220" instead of "2024"). This is a separate issue from the data population and can be addressed if needed.

## Database Details

- **Documents**: 91

## API Endpoint
